Please execute the index.php
You have to enter the string in text box like CCCCC or ABCDAD
On clicking the scan button you will see the total

There is one Item class which intialises the four items A,B,C and D with their prices ,name and code 
Terminal class is used to calculate the total of passed items 
Terminal class uses iterator interface  which helps to iterate the object as an array
No database is used 
As per my understanding all the things are tried to be implemented using classes and objects
